W3C Status Descriptors

	- Working Draft (WD)
	- Candidate Recommendation (CR)
	- Proposed Recommendation (PR)
	- W3C Recommendation (REC)

In short, if it's not "(ST) Standard", then, it's not an "official" standard


A simple example: battery API

	- Purpose of API: to get battery status
	- MDN status*: (CR)
	- Suppored on*:
		- Chrome (on Desktop or Android)
		- Firefox
	- Not supported on*:
		- Safari
		- Chrome on iOS

	* status as of April 2017

	- BatteryManager object
	- Page on MDN lists members:
		- charging (bool)
			- indicated whether or not the battery is currently charging
		- chargingTime (num)
		- dischargingTime (num)
		- level (num)

	- How to get the BatteryManager object:
		- window.navigator.getBattery() function
			- or just navigator.getBattery()

	- Promise object
		- used for async computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.
		- Many APIs access "system" functionality (core devices/serviecs)
		- user may not want to give browser access to these devices/sevices
		- When promises are used in code, the user may be prompted by the browser to allow access
			- Whenever the user decides, then the primise is resolved (fulfilled or rejected)
			- hance a lot of these newer APIs giving back Promise objects

		- promiseObject.then function takes 2 functions as parameters
			- first is the function to call if promise is fulfilled
			- second is the function to call if promise is rejected



function GetPos(timestamp) {
	// this.data
	// Find 2 points with times
	// before and after
	var before, after
	var weight = (aftertime - beforetime) / (tiimestamp - beforetime)
}
